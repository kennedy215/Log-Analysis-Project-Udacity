## Log Analysis Project

In this project, you'll work with data that could have come from a real-world web application, with fields representing information that a web server would record, such as HTTP status codes and URL paths. The web server and the reporting tool both connect to the same database, allowing information to flow from the web server into the report.

## How It Works

Building an informative summary from logs

## Requirements

To start on this project, you'll need database software (provided by a Linux virtual machine) and the data to analyze.

The virtual machine
This project makes use of a Linux-based virtual machine (VM),PostgreSQL database and support software needed for this project. If you need to bring the virtual machine back online (with vagrant up), do so now. Then log into it with vagrant ssh.


## Directions

### How to Run Application

The file inside is called newsdata.sql. Put this file into the vagrant directory, which is shared with your virtual machine.

To build the reporting tool, you'll need to load the site's data into your local database. Review how to use the psql command in this lesson.

To load the data, cd into the vagrant directory and use the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql.
Here's what this command does:

psql — the PostgreSQL command line program
-d news — connect to the database named news which has been set up for you
-f newsdata.sql — run the SQL statements in the file newsdata.sql
Running this command will connect to your installed database server and execute the SQL commands in the downloaded file, creating tables and populating them with data.
